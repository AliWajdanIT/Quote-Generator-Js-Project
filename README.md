# Quote of the Day
A simple web application that displays a new inspirational quote each time you click a button. You can also listen to the quote, copy it to your clipboard, or share it on Twitter.

## About
This project displays a random quote every time you press the "New Quote" button. It fetches quotes from an external API and includes buttons to hear the quote, copy it to the clipboard, or share it on Twitter.

## Features
- **New Quote Button**: Fetches a new quote from the API.
- **Speech Functionality**: Reads out the quote aloud.
- **Copy Functionality**: Copies the quote to the clipboard.
- **Twitter Sharing**: Opens a link to share the quote on Twitter.

## How I Made It
1. **HTML**: I created the basic structure of the page using HTML, including a card to display the quote and the author's name.
2. **CSS**: Styled the card, buttons, and other elements to make the design visually appealing.
3. **JavaScript**: Added interactivity with JavaScript. When you click the "New Quote" button, it fetches a new quote from the API. I used event listeners to add functionality for the speech, copy, and Twitter buttons.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For creating the structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: For styling the webpage.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity and fetching quotes from the API.
- **FontAwesome**: For the icons used in the buttons.
- **Quotable API**: To get random quotes.

## Future Improvements Maybe
- Add more animations and styling to the page.
- Include more functionalities like saving favorite quotes.
- Add a feature to display quotes from a specific category or author.
